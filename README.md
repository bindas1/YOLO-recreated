Copy the API from the sign up process is complete and paste to the terminal. (This process only needs to be done once)

After the login you should see that the data is being downloaded. If You want to make sure that the installation process is complete I suggest running the code with `config["is_one_batch"]` set to `True` in `main.py`.

You can access all the metrics in your profile, each run produces new instance on wandb page.

### FAQ
If you receive the RuntimeErrror: CUDA out of memory You should change the `batch_size` in `config` in `main.py` to smaller number.
