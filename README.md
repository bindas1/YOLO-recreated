Go to https://wandb.ai/authorize?signup=true, sign in using github, google or create account.

Copy the API after the sign up process is complete and paste to the terminal. (This process only needs to be done once)

After the login you should see that the data is being downloaded. If You want to make sure that the installation process is complete I suggest running the code with `config["is_one_batch"]` set to `True` in `main.py`.
